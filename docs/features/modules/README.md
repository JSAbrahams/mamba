## Introduction

A module is one of the following:

Module type | Description
------------|--------------
script      | A sequence of Instructions.
type        | A blueprint for a class, defines the behaviour of a class.
statlful    | A blueprint for an instance of an stateful object. Defines the behaviour of that object, and may implement a type.
stateless   | A blueprint for a singelton, stateless object. Only one instance of such an object can exist, and its state may never change. It can implement a type.

A file may contain either a script accompanied by functions, or a mix of type, stateful and stateless modules. 
It is generally best to have at most one type per file for readability sake.
